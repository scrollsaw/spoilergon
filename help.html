<br><br>
Spoilergon works by using keywords to create filters to block articles
<br><br>
There are three types of keywords that can be used individually OR in groups to identify articles to block.
<ul>
<li><b>tag/category:</b> Articles can have tags or categories. Enter a matching keyword here to block all articles with a tag that matches the keyword.
</li>
<li><b>byline:</b> Articles can have bylines (or authors). Enter a matching keyword here to block all articles with a byline that matches the keyword.
</li>
<li><b>title or copy keyword:</b> Enter a matching keyword here to block all articles where the keyword appears in the title or initial copy.
</li>
</ul>
When creating filters that use a combination of more than one type, both must be present to block the article.<br>
Example : tag =  "Opinion" and title = "Game of Thrones" will only block articles tagged as "Opinion" with "Game of Thrones" in the title or copy.
<br><br>
<b>Tips:</b>
<ul>
<li>Filters work across all three sites automatically.</li>
<li>Filters use exact matching. So "Mr Robot" (missing the period) will NOT block articles if they use the phrase "Mr. Robot" </li>
<li>Depending on where articles appear on the page, bylines might not be shown. Therefore filters that use them won't be able to block them.</li>
<li>When a filter has more then one keyword and if one is not shown on the article (ex: byline), spoilergon will still block the article it it matches the other tags.</li>
<li>Play around with it, you'll get the hang of it quickly.</li>
</ul>
<b>Example:</b>
<br>
To block Game of Thrones spoilers:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Create one filter with tag = blank, byline = blank and title/copy = "Game of Thrones"
  <br>That should block any articles with Game of Thrones in the title or copy/description.
  </li>
<li>To ensure that no spoilers slip through, create another filter with tag = "Game of Thrones" byline = blank and title = blank.<br>
That will block any articles tagged with "Game of Thrones", even if the title or copy doesn't use the phrase "Game of Thrones"</li>
</ol>
enjoy!
